actually meant?"

Very recently, I was implementing a solution that required cross communication
between a .NET Backend and a JAVA client and while I was researching a possible
solution, I came across a term called Two's complement and along with this term
was a mathematical explanation of what it was.
I actually felt that it is just a big term that people use to cloud their own
lack of understanding on the concept.

In this post, I shall explain what I learn about Two's complement and what a
complement of a number actually mean.
