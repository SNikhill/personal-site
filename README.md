My **_Personal Estate_** on the World Wide Web. Bootstrapped using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and
hosted on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/) with [Dato](https://www.datocms.com/)
as CMS.

The Design was made by me. Yes, it is not that impressive but, it is something, and I proud of the effort
that I made. It actually helped me explore Adobe XD and Figma.

# Future

For now, I plan on making certain design changes, and I shall be also implementing a blog.
